# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing 
# Overview:
  This project is focused on harvesting data from YouTube channels using the YouTube API, processing the data, and warehousing it. The harvested data is initially stored in a MongoDB Atlas database as documents and is then converted into SQL records for in-depth data analysis. The project's core functionality relies on the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process.
